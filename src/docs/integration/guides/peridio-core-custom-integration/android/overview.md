# Overview

Peridio can be integrated with any variant of the Android OS by programming against the Peridio [Device API](/device-api) via [direct API integration](/integration/guides/peridio-core-custom-integration/android/reference-designs/direct-api-integration).

## Reference agent

The code that runs on a device that integrates with Peridio is referred to as a Peridio Agent. For a platform-agnostic overview of its optional and required capabilities, please reference the [Peridio Agent](/integration/guides/peridio-core-custom-integration/introduction#agent) documentation.

`peridiod`, the standard Peridio agent reference implementation, does not currently support Android-specific interfaces, e.g., interacting with Android APIs and libraries to:

- **Install APKs**: Managing package installations directly on the device using the Android Package Manager (e.g., `PackageInstaller` API).
- **Perform A/B updates**: Orchestrating seamless updates using the Android A/B (seamless updates) system, which involves switching between active and inactive partitions while ensuring rollback protection.
- **Store configuration and metadata**: Persisting configuration or metadata in areas that survive across reboots, are independent of A/B partitions, and are not wiped during factory resets (e.g., storing in a device-protected storage area or using Android's Key-Value Backup or Device Owner features).

These capabilities require deeper integration with Android's ecosystem than the current implementation provides.

Support for Android-specific capabilities in `peridiod` is in-progress, but not yet ready for general consumption. If you would like to participate in a private beta, please reach out.

The implication of the above is that while the surface area of the Peridio Device API is intentionally small to minimize integration efforts, there will be non-repeatable engineering required to complete the last-mile of integration: the download and application of binaries served by the Peridio Device API.

## Reference designs

While Android-specific hardware reference designs are still in private beta, the following options are available:

- [Direct API integration](/integration/guides/peridio-core-custom-integration/android/reference-designs/direct-api-integration).
- Peridio maintains opinionated reference implementations for a variety of development kits and evaluation boards with respect to Embedded Linux platforms. These will still serve as a helpful context when reasoning about system design with Peridio. For more information, refer to the [Linux reference designs](/integration/guides/peridio-core-custom-integration/linux/overview#reference-designs).
