# Seeed reTerminal

![reTerminal](/img/reterminal.jpg)

Seeed Studio's reTerminal is an industrial HMI with the same Raspberry Pi 4 compute module at its heart, but wrapped in a touchscreen interface, expanded I/O, and a form factor designed for real-world deployment.

Since the reTerminal is just a Raspberry Pi 4 with extra peripherals, you can use Avocado OS to develop your application on a Raspberry Pi 4, then quickly retarget your finished Linux image for production hardware.

### Provisioning your device

1. Initialize your project

```bash
avocado init --target reterminal avocado-reterminal
cd avocado-reterminal
```

2. Install all components (SDK, extensions, and runtime dependencies):

```bash
avocado install -f
```

3. Build all components

```bash
avocado build
```

4. Provision a runtime

```bash
avocado provision -r dev
```
