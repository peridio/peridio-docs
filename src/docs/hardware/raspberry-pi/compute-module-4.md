The Raspberry Pi 4 is the world’s most widely adopted single-board computer—powerful, affordable, and perfect for rapid prototyping and deployment. With up to 8GB of RAM and a quad-core Cortex-A72 processor, it’s more than capable of running advanced workloads at the edge.

When paired with Avocado OS, developers can accelerate time to production with a streamlined, repeatable Linux development environment—no complex toolchains, no custom Yocto builds.

## Getting Started

Get up and running with the Avocado OS SDK in minutes.

### Prerequisites

- A Mac (macOS 10.12+) or Linux (Ubuntu 22.04+, Fedora 39+) development machine
- Docker installed
- 3GB+ available disk space

### Provisioning your device

1. Initialize your project

```bash
avocado init --target raspberrypi4 avocado-rpi4
cd avocado-rpi4
```

2. Install all components (SDK, extensions, and runtime dependencies):

```bash
avocado install -f
```

3. Build all components

```bash
avocado build
```

4. Provision a runtime

```bash
avocado provision -r dev
```
