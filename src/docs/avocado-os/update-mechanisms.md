:::caution Under Development
This documentation is currently under active development. Content and procedures may change as we refine the Avocado OS platform.
:::

Avocado OS implements fault-tolerant update mechanisms designed for reliability under adverse conditions. The system uses btrfs for atomic updates and integrity verification, ensuring that updates either complete successfully or roll back cleanly without leaving the system in an inconsistent state. This approach provides operational continuity even in challenging deployment environments.

The update architecture includes intelligent power management with ordered shutdown sequences initiated on power failure to protect data integrity. Store-and-forward architecture uses a transaction-based model for system management operations, ensuring consistency even with intermittent connectivity. These mechanisms work together to provide robust update deployment capabilities across diverse operational conditions.

**Update System Features:**
- Atomic updates using btrfs filesystem capabilities
- Fault-tolerant update deployment with automatic rollback
- Transaction-based update model for consistency
- Power failure protection during update processes

**Reliability Mechanisms:**
- Intelligent power management and ordered shutdown sequences
- Store-and-forward architecture for intermittent connectivity
- Integrity verification throughout update process
- Operational continuity in challenging environments
