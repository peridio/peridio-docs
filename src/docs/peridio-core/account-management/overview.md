# Account Management

Account management in Peridio provides the foundation for organizing resources, controlling access, and managing users across your IoT infrastructure. This system enables secure multi-tenancy, role-based access control, and hierarchical resource organization.

## Core Components

### [Organizations](organizations)
The top-level container for all Peridio resources, providing isolation and management boundaries for your IoT deployments.

### [Users](users)
Individual accounts that interact with the Peridio platform, with configurable roles and permissions.

### [Peridio Resource Names (PRNs)](/peridio-core/peridio-resource-names)
Unique identifiers that unambiguously specify resources across the entire Peridio platform.

## Key Features

- **Multi-tenancy**: Isolate resources and users across different organizations
- **Role-based Access Control**: Define granular permissions for users within organizations
- **Resource Hierarchy**: Organize resources in a logical structure for easier management
